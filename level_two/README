About models:
    - create models.py file inside <app_name>
    - run migrate makemigrate migrate commands in sequence (makemigrate migrate each time you modify models)
    - add the models to <app_name>/admin.py with the admin.site.register function (then you can access with superuser
    credentials)
Create dummy data:
    - pip install Faker
    - add a script with the rows for configuring project settings first
    - run the script and check if it worked from /admin
- visit the webpage to look for mistakes
